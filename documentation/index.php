      <p>Validations are a means of allowing VATSIM members who are not pre&ndash;authorised to log on and control a position to do so. These validations include Solo Tower Validations (STVs).</p>
      <p>In the course of their training, a VATeir student may be given an STV or other relevant validation before they have attained the requisite VATSIM rating to log on to a position.</p>
      <p>The student's mentor submits the validation on the student's behalf. This must then be approved by a member of the staff of the training department before the validation is considered active. At this point it will display on the student's <i>Validations</i> page and on the list of validated students available to VATSIM supervisors.</p>

      <p>The <i>Training History</i> page is the location where all of the mentoring reports, notes, and other training-related errata which pertain to you as a student are stored. Other students do not have access to this page, and only VATeir mentors with the requisite permissions and VATeir staff have access to your history.</p>
      <p>At the top of this page is the <i>Training Details</i> section, wherein you will find details including your current ATC Rating, Pilot Rating, VATSIM and VATeir registration dates, Activity Status on the Network and on the VATeir website, Current Training Programme, and the type of controller that you are (Home Controller or Visiting Controller).</p>

      <h6 id="1.5.2">1.5.2 Deck of Cards</h6>
      <p>The method of storing mentoring reports, notes, and information related to sessions is through the use of a 'deck of cards'. For each mentoring report, a card is added to your training history with information contained thereon, including the mentor's comments, and progression through the training syllabus.</p>
      <p>The deck of cards is colour-coded to speed up recognition of a particular card type. The colours of the various cards are given below.</p>
      <p>After a number of sessions, you may notice that the deck of cards begins to fill up as mentors add more and more records to your training history.</p>
      <p>One important point to note is that a card will only appear once the mentor has added a report or a note to your training history. These reports and notes are not system-generated and it might take a number of days before the mentor gets around to filling out a report for a particular session.</p>
      <p>Cards are ordered by date from bottom to top, which means that the most recent card will always be at the top of the deck.</p>
      <p>Specific details about the different card types are discussed in more detail below.</p>
      <p>Each card is telescoped in order to save space on the page. It might be necessary to click on the <i>More</i> or <i> Less </i> links in order to view the rest of your mentoring report or note.</p>
      <p><strong>Cards are ordered by the date on which the card was submitted, and not the date on which a session may have taken place.</strong></p>

          <li>That the availability record is valid for a future date and time;</li>
          <li>That an availability has not been already picked up by a mentor scheduling a mentoring session with the student;</li>

        <p>The <i>Schedule Session</i> page allows you to book a mentoring session or exam with a student. After having booked the session, the site will send both mentor and student an email confirming the session booking.</p>
        <p>If the mentoring session will take place on the VATSIM network (either <i>Live</i> or <i>Exam</i> report types), the website will also display the session on the front page, on the events page, and will push the mentoring session to calendar applications via the site's calendar feature, discussed above. This will hopefully drive more traffic for your session.</p>
        <p>In order to book a mentoring session, a mentor must fill out a simple form, pictured below.</p>

          <p>The selection of a report type at this stage will have an impact on the syllabus items which will be displayed on the student's mentoring report later on. Care must be taken to select the correct mentoring report type for the type of session that will be taking place.</p>
          <p>In order to change the types of reports offered by the site, a mentor must request of a member of TD Staff that a student's programme be changed. After this has been done, a mentor can then select the correct report type.</p>

        <ol>

      <h6 id="2.4.1">2.4.1 What is it?</h6>
      <p>The validations feature allows the training department to keep track of everyone's validations. Mentors can submit a validation request on behalf of a student, however the must be approved by a member of TD Staff before it comes in to effect and before it shows up in a student's list of validations list.</p>
      <br>
      <h6 id="2.4.2">2.4.2 Views</h6>
      <p>The validation list is split up into two views. The default view is the <i>Sector</i> view, whereas to access the <i>Position</i> view, a mentor must click on the <i>Position View</i> link at the top right of the list of validations.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <h6 id="2.4.2.1">2.4.2.1 Sector View</h6>
        <p>The sector view offers a 'top-down' representation of a student's validations. For example, if a student is shown to be validated on EIDW_TWR, that means that they are also validated on EIDW_DEL and EIDW_GND. This is to ensure that all validations are explicity stated in the event of queries from VATSIM supervisors over the validity of a student's validation.</p>
        <br>

      <h6 id="2.4.3">2.4.3 Student's Validations</h6>
      <p>A student's <i>Validations</i> page can be accessed either by clicking on their name in the Validations list, or by following the <a href="#2.3.4.1">link in their training details</a>.</p>
      <p>The page includes details of positions on which the student is validated to control, the mentor who issued the validation, the date from when the validation takes effect, the date of expiry of the validation and options.</p>
      <p>To <strong>extend</strong> a validation, click on the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh" aria-hidden="true"></span> icon besidee the validatoin which you would like to extend.</p>
      <p>To <strong>delete</strong> a validation, click on the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove" aria-hidden="true"></span> icon besidee the validatoin which you would like to delete.</p>
      <p>To add a validation, click on the relevant sector from the menu on the right. This will validate the student on all positions <strong>up</strong> to that sector at the chosen airfield. For example, by clicking on <code>APP</code> under Dublin, this will validate the student on DEL, GND, TWR, and APP at once. If the student already has validations on the lower sectors, these validations are extended to the lifetime of the upper validation.</p>
      <p>Students are validated for <strong>60 days</strong>, after which their validation must renewed, otherwise they will be no longer validated.</p>
      <p>Rows which are orange in colour indicate validations which haven't been approved by TD Staff. As such, validations which are orange do not count as validations. In the example below, the student must wait for the training department to approve the validation for <code>EIDW_APP</code> before they are validated.</p>
      <p>The site publishes a list of validations in the form of a <code>txt</code> document for use by network supervisors. This link can be accessed <a href="<?php echo BASE_URL; ?>atc_solo/solo.txt" target="_blank">here</a>. This file is updated automatically when a validation is added, deleted, or updated.</p>
