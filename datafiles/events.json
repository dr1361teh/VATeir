This doesn&#39;t happen easily. Pilots must be fully ready for departure at the holding point, and when cleared to line up and depart, do so with no delay. All whilst looking down the endless stream of strobes on approach. Arrivals will have to be thrown into the sequence too - making the runway operations at Dublin intense, challenging, and great fun for everyone. Each pilot will be entered into a draw for a chance to win Dublin&#39;s best scenery - Aerosoft&#39;s Mega Airport Dublin. Keep Saturday the 9th of April free for this event, fly from/to your favourite airport into or out of Dublin, and enjoy the full staffing of ATC from VAT&eacute;ir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find charts here: http://iaip.iaa.ie/iaip/aip_eidw_charts.htm<br />\r\nEssential info for pilots, pages 15-17: http://iaip.iaa.ie/iaip/Published%20Files/AIP%20Files/AD/EI_AD_2_EIDW_EN.pdf</p>\r\n","ends":"2016-04-09T21:00:00Z","id":3140,"starts":"2016-04-09T18:00:00Z","subtitle":"Dublin turns up the pressure","title":"Dublin High Intensity Runway Ops","vaccs":null,"weekly_hash":null,"subdivisions":[{"code":"IRL","name":"vACC Ireland"}]},{"airports":"EIDW","banner_url":"http://img.ie/02tmz.png","description":"<p>VATeir is pleased to invite you to visit Dublin Airport (EIDW) on&nbsp;Friday 26th September&nbsp;from&nbsp;1800Z.
